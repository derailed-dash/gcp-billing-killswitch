## Testing Strategy for Kill GCP Project Billing Function

Given the critical and destructive nature of the 'Kill GCP Project Billing' Cloud Function, a robust, multi-layered testing strategy is essential to ensure its reliability and safety.

### 1. Unit Testing (Already Implemented)

*   **Purpose:** To verify individual components (e.g., `disable_billing_for_project` function) in isolation.
*   **Method:** Mock external dependencies (Cloud Billing API, Pub/Sub, Logging) to ensure the function's logic is correct under various scenarios (budget exceeded, budget not exceeded, missing IDs, multiple projects).
*   **Current Status:** Comprehensive unit tests are already in place in `tests/test_main.py`.

### 2. Integration Testing (Staging Environment)

*   **Purpose:** To verify that your Cloud Function correctly interacts with *real* Google Cloud services (Pub/Sub, Cloud Billing API) in a controlled, non-production environment.

*   **Strategy:**
    *   **Dedicated Test Project:** Create a completely isolated Google Cloud project specifically for testing this function. This project should be easily disposable. Create a `budget-alerts` Pub/Sub topic in this project.
    *   **Real Pub/Sub Topic:** Deploy your Cloud Function to this test project, ensuring it's subscribed to a *real* Pub/Sub topic within that project.
    *   **Simulated Budget Alerts:** Manually publish Pub/Sub messages to this topic that precisely mimic the structure of a Cloud Billing budget alert. \
        ```bash
        # Make sure we're using a test project before proceeding
        export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=$DEV_GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT
        export TEST_PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gcloud projects describe $GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT --format="value(projectNumber)")

        # Deploy the Cloud Function to the test project
        source scripts/deploy.sh

        # CREATE TEST MSG
        # Replace placeholders using values from env vars
        sed "s/BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID/${BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID}/g; s/TEST_PROJECT_NUMBER/${TEST_PROJECT_NUMBER}/g" \
            tests/budget_alert.json.template > tests/budget_alert.json

        msg=$(cat tests/budget_alert.json)

        # Publish the message
        gcloud pubsub topics publish $PUB_SUB_TOPIC \
            --project="$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT" \
            --message="$msg" \
            --attribute="budgetId=my-test-budget-id"

        # Now we can read the Cloud Function logs
        ```

        *   **Success Case:** Publish a message indicating a budget has been exceeded for a *test project* (a project within your test billing account that you are willing to have billing disabled for). Verify that billing is successfully disabled for that test project.
        *   **Failure Cases:** Publish messages for scenarios where billing *should not* be disabled (e.g., cost not exceeding budget, missing `budgetId`, missing `billingAccountId`, budget not scoped to any project). Verify that billing remains enabled and appropriate logs are generated.
    *   **Verification:** Use `gcloud` commands or the Cloud Console to confirm:
        *   The Cloud Function was triggered.
        *   Logs generated by the function are as expected.
        *   The billing status of the target test project(s) is as expected.

### 3. End-to-End Testing (Staging Environment with Real Budget)

*   **Purpose:** To validate the entire workflow, from a real Cloud Billing budget alert triggering the function to the function successfully disabling billing.

*   **Strategy:**
    *   **Dedicated Test Project & Billing Account:** Set up another dedicated, isolated Google Cloud project and, ideally, a separate *test billing account* (or a billing account with very strict controls) for this.
    *   **Real Budget:** Configure a *real* Cloud Billing budget in this test billing account, targeting a specific test project within that account. Set a very low threshold (e.g., $1) and link it to the Pub/Sub topic that triggers your deployed Cloud Function.
    *   **Triggering:** Incur a small amount of cost in the target test project to trigger the budget alert.
    *   **Verification:** Monitor the Pub/Sub topic, Cloud Function logs, and the billing status of the target test project. Confirm that the budget alert triggers the function and billing is disabled as expected.

### 4. Monitoring and Alerting (Production Deployment)

*   **Purpose:** To ensure the function operates correctly in production and provides immediate notification of any issues.

*   **Strategy:**
    *   **Cloud Logging:** Ensure your function's logs are comprehensive and include critical information (e.g., project ID, billing account ID, outcome of billing disablement).
    *   **Cloud Monitoring & Alerting:** Set up Cloud Monitoring alerts for:
        *   **Function Errors:** Alert on any errors or exceptions logged by the Cloud Function.
        *   **Function Invocations:** Monitor the number of times the function is invoked.
        *   **Billing Status Changes:** If feasible, set up alerts on changes to project billing status.
        *   **Budget Alerts:** Monitor the Pub/Sub topic for incoming budget alert messages.

This layered approach will provide the highest level of confidence in your function's reliability and safety, especially given its critical role in managing your GCP billing.
